# How to Run
  * Add your experiment parameters in the *parameter.txt* line by line,
    following the schema.
  * Compile java
  * *bash script.sh*

# TODO list
  * Add your names and id in each class
  * Perform comphrensive experiments to show the replication is the same as the
    Netlogo one. Document any findings during the implementation.
  * Analyze and illustrate with graph and chart to find any insights in some
    typical parameter settings of the model.
  * Compare multiple runs with the same parameters to conclude whether the
    behaviour is same or different in each run.
  * Raise a hypothesis/question and extend the model to analyze/prove your
    hypo/problem. Should justify the reason why you extend the model in such
way.
  * Implements the extension in both netlogo and java.
  * Run comphrensive experiments on the extended model to address the
    questions.
  * Follow the specification criteria part strictly!
